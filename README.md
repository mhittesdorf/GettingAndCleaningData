# Getting And Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository processes data collected from a wearable computing study. The full description of the study can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. 

This project demonstrates how to merge, shape and summarize data to create a final 'tidy' data set which can be found in the output file 'mean_by_activity_and_subject.txt'.  The output file is created by the script 'run_analysis.R', which can be found in the 'UCI HAR Dataset' subdirectory.

More information about the fields in the output file is available in the code book markdown file 'CodeBook.md'. The code book also contains an overview of the steps implemented by the 'run_analysis.R' script to transform the raw data into the 'tidy' output file.
